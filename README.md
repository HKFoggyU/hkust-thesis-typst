## Disclaimer

FYTGS doesn't provide any template for thesis submission. They only emphasize that the submitted PDF file should meet the requirements in the [RPG Handbook](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/academics/Academic-Regulations-and-Requirements/Handbook-for-Research-Postgraduate-Studies/guidelines-thesis-preparation).

This template has tried its best to follow the above requirements in the RPG Handbook and also the formatting instructions of the sample pages ([MPhil](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/imce/thesis_sample_page_mphil.pdf)/[PhD](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/sites/default/files/imce/thesis_sample_page_phd.pdf)) provided by the RPG Handbook. However, this template takes no responsibility for any potential inconsistency.
